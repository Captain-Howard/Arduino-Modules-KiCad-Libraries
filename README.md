# Arduino-Modules-KiCad-Libraries
As I make projects I'm finding I need more and more KiCad parts and they either exist as horrible designs or are inaccessible. I'm hoping to make these as I go, so if some parts are incomplete please make not of it and I'll get around to it.


Keep in mind right now I'm just working in Eeshema (Schematic Layout Editor). So these won't be able to be tested or printed quite yet. I'm working on designs and code for this, but as of right now it is not published.

Modules Created:
 - Arduino Nano
 - 1602 i2c
 - Bluefruit LE UART Friend (from Adafruit)
 - HC-05 Bluetooth
 - 2-pin White LED Strip
